Dataset: [BIDMC Dataset](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/bidmc_dataset.html)

The BIDMC dataset is a dataset of electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram, PPG) and impedance pneumography respiratory signals acquired from intensive care patients. The dataset is intended to be used for evaluating the performance of respiratory rate algorithms, reflecting their potential performance in a real-world critical care environment.
